# note-taker

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to be able to use express.js to create GET and POST routes successfuly and to communicate
  my backend server with the front end.
- I built this project to have an application that can save, read and delete notes inputed by the user.
- This application solves the problem of having a place to keep track of all your notes and things to do.
- I learned how to use Express.js to communicate with the front end of the application and how to successfully create routes in my JavaScript files.
